This script will scan through email and pull the top bigrams and trigrams, storing them in a database to occasionally topically classify and generate a report or two.

Uses:
- Run "make build" to pull daily emails from gmail (in the 24 hour period starting from yesterday's midnight).  The timeframe can be adjusted in "gmail.py".
